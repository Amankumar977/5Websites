Choosing clear and descriptive names helps us in many manners

1. It increases redeability -> Like if i write the name sum of the function which is doing sum of two numbers instead of any random name like x, y,z then it will increase the readabilty.

2) It increase mantanabilty -> It will increase the chnages of maintaing the code in a better manner.
3) It increase Scalabilty -> As we can reuse the same name again and agaain.
