So the comments are very important aspect of coding why

1. We will not always look the whole code -> suppose you wrote a code today and after so day you want to find out what that piece of code is doing then we might have to look the whole code but if we have written a comment that what the code is doing then we can know without going through the code.

2) We will not always be there in our life we change so many company and each time a new person joins commets help them identify what the code is doing.
3) Easy to debug.

Single line comment means we have written the comment in single line. //
Multi line comment means the comment in which we have written the comment in multiple line with use of /\*\* \*/
