A version control system is a system which stores the different versions of a application.
Like we have some code written in our computer and what we want is to store the code so that i can get it even after my computer is not working in that we can use version control system.
It is important because in day to day development we write a lot of code and we make a lot of verion of the system so we must have to store all the versions and in that case version contol is very useful.
