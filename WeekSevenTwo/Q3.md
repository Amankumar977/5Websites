Gitignore file is a very important file which helps us to ignore the unimportant files which doesn't needs to be pushed.
for example when we make any node project we have to install some dependencies which can be used so that we can make some project like tailwind and what we have to do in tailwind is to install npm pacakkges so we put the node module in gitignore so that git can ignore it.
