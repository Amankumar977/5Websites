The workflow is a below =>

1. We make a local repo in our computer and we write code in that repo andd we store it in our computer.
2. When we use any version control what happens it gets stored in a vserion control system which we can retrieve any time.
3. Firstly we Write the command git add . it moves our code from local repo to Staging area.
4. Then we write the command git commit -m "Changes made" after this command the code get's pushed to repo of git.
5. Git push command pushes the code to the git software.
