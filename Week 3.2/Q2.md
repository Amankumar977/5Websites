Difference Between position absolute and relative

1. Position Relative =>This is used when you have to move the element from its normal flow. It will move the element from it's acutal place but that place will not be filled by anyone else.

2) Position Absolute : This is used when you have to move the element from it's positioned parent. It will move and it's place can be filled by others.
